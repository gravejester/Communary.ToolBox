        .SYNOPSIS
            Get the Hamming Distance between two strings.
        .DESCRIPTION
            The Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.
            In another way, it measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other, or the minimum number of errors that could have transformed one string into the other.
            Note! Even though the original Hamming algorithm only works for strings of equal length, this function supports strings of unequal length as well.
        .EXAMPLE
            Get-HammingDistance  -Source 'karolin' -Target 'kathrin'
