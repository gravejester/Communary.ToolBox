        .SYNOPSIS
            Get the Jaccard Distance between two strings.
        .DESCRIPTION
            The Jaccard distance, which measures dissimilarity between sample sets, is complementary to the 
            Jaccard coefficient and is obtained by subtracting the Jaccard coefficient from 1, or, equivalently, 
            by dividing the difference of the sizes of the union and the intersection of two sets by the size of the union
        .EXAMPLE
            Get-JaccardDistance 'karolin' 'kharolin'
