        .SYNOPSIS
            Get the standard variation of a set of numbers.
        .DESCRIPTION
            In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure that is used to quantify
            the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. A standard deviation
            close to 0 indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean
            (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates
            that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.
        .EXAMPLE
            Get-StandardDeviation -Set $mySet
