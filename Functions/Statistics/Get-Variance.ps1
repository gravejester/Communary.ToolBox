        .SYNOPSIS
            Get the variance of a set of numbers.
        .DESCRIPTION
            In probability theory and statistics, variance measures how far a set of numbers are spread out.
            A variance of zero indicates that all the values are identical. Variance is always non-negative: a small
            variance indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean (expected value) and hence to each other,
            while a high variance indicates that the data points are very spread out around the mean and from each other.
